Your response MUST follow these rules:
1. Create a complete, working project using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
2. Do NOT use any frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, or Next.js
3. Use Tailwind CSS for styling (via CDN link)
4. Format your response with clear file markers using the format: // FILE: filename.ext
5. Add realistic data and functionality
6. Add appropriate comments explaining the code
7. Ensure the code works directly in browsers without any build steps

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BROWSER COMPATIBILITY:
1. ALWAYS include an index.html file as the main entry point
2. Include all JavaScript in separate .js files
3. Include all CSS in separate .css files (except Tailwind)
4. Use standard Tailwind CSS classes for styling
5. Use proper HTML5 semantic elements
6. Ensure all JavaScript is properly scoped and organized
7. Use ES6+ features but ensure browser compatibility
8. Include the Tailwind CSS CDN in the HTML file

File structure should include:
- index.html (main entry point)
- styles.css (custom styles)
- script.js (main JavaScript file)
- Additional JS files for specific functionality
- Any necessary assets (in an assets/ directory)

Each file should be complete and properly formatted with the file marker.`
